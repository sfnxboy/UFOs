# UFOs

## Overview
JavaScript provides a high level of customization used to deliver visual data, such as maps or graphs, and can be as simple or complex as needed. In this project we take a JavaScript file filled with UFO sighting information including information such as date of sighting, city, state, country, and shape of UFO. JavaScript’s visual functionality allows us to display the data on a table, and manipulate the data using filters. To display the data in a tidy manner we use HTML. To spruce up the page a bit we added specific CSS components to the stylesheet. To further customize the website, we use the popular web development framework Bootstrap. 

## Results
This website is simple and easy to navigate. Whoever is interested in the owner’s thoughts on the subject can easily find a short opening statement to the website upon entering the site. The table of data instantly loads upon entering the site as well, making it readily available for any UFO enthusiast. If a visitor wishes to filter the data, they may be able to do so using the Filter Search section of the website. Although a Filter button was part of previous versions of the website, a visitor can now type their parameters into the respective input box and press enter to instantly clean the data to suit their interests. To give users a better idea of the format they should enter their parameters in, each input box within the filter search section contains a placeholder.
